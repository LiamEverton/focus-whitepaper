# focus-whitepaper

## What is this?

Me and my 2 friends entered into a start-up competition which was hosted by Lancaster University's entreprenurship society.

We were given 3 words to center our idea from. However, I cannot recall them.

The objective was to come up with an idea that was eco-friendly and ultimately reduce paper use. There was also some other very restrictive stipulations that made the idea have to be extremely nuanced.

The winner would get access to the university's resources and a 1000GBP fund given by the EU scheme sponsoring the event.

## What did we come up with?

Within a few minutes I already came up with what we would later decide upon.

We were the smallest group. Most teams had atleast 5 members, and with only ~5 hours to actually build something, we decided to stay up through the night so that we could not only deliever a presentation, but a prototype and a whitepaper to go along with an idea we believed to be well-worth the investment of our time.

## My Team

It was my idea to enter the competition, so I naturally assumed the leader role. I gave them a plan of my idea, micro-managed and made sure we all knew exactly what we wanted to bring to life, while being able to collabrate freely. By the time we begun, we all had a singular focus (no pun intended) as to what this project was.

My friend, Adil, who was second in command and helped direct the creative process of the paper and powerpoint. He quality assured everything, every final touch was made by him, giving quick and precise feedback as to what we need to improve or change. His role naturally became the creative.

His friend, who we refer to as "Wizoid", assumed the role of our main turning cog for our project. We needed to crunch hard, the idea was to present a whitepaper which other groups wouldn't have had time to produce, since the competition's objective was a 5 minute powerpoint. 

This was our chance to gain a massive advantage, despite our numbers disadvantage.

The whitepaper would include much more in-depth market research, the benefits and story of our solution. We gave Charlie a set of questions we needed answering and we let him loose on crunching the data required, he'd pass that off to Adil, who would make the infographics while I was writing our story and creating the powerpoint which I would later present.

## The Process

As soon as we were set to work, I started spewing my idea. The guys had some clue of what the hell I was rambling about, but I had to make sure we were all on the same page. I refined my idea, constructed a set of key features and benefits and they were sold.

Now it was time to create a plan. We had half the numbers, we needed a real advantage.

I decided that after spending the year trading cryptocurrency, it'd be smart to create a whitepaper.

A whitepaper being a small document that is essentially the products biography.

Everyone agreed, it was a smart plan, since we had fleshed out the idea faster than others. They were still brainstorming and speaking to other groups.

I made sure we isolated ourselves. If we started second-guessing ourselves at this point, it'd ruin our direction. I wanted people to really engage with what we had to offer, for it to be brand new on the day of the presentation.

Anyways.

I quickly hashed up a work plan and began putting everyone to work. My primary role was to manage and write our whitepaper, and use Wizoid to help me create and populate it, and Adil to help me design and refine it.

This was going to take awhile. We had used up all our time, and we wasn't done. All the groups were packing up and heading home. We decided to stay some while longer.

I told my teammates that we can hold up in my dorm while we hash the rest out, since It'd be faster to get this done on my main computer. Somewhat of a mistake on my part, because while we had our own space, we were 3 grown men crammed into a tiny dorm which was soon to be consumed by Wizoid's extremely funky feet smell.

I demanded a lot of out of my team, and they knew why. We needed real data. If I was to make the argument that this was a eco-friendly option, we needed evidence. I made sure Wizoid knew what were looking for, but boy did we have to dig for that data.

The whitepaper was in okay hands, but this was before I studied Copywriting or any art of writing a perfect proposal. I was very much in my infancy of delievering these types of things, but everyone agreed that it'd be best for me to do the writing, since it was my idea, I had to see it through.

In the end, we got it all done and we was all very tired. I was planning on taking my team out to eat the day after, to celebrate a win. I was hopeful.

## The Outcome

When the time came, we printed our white-paper, put them infront of the judges and I presented our powerpoint.

We decided in the end to scrap the prototype. Nobody else would have one, but ultimately I wanted to show the audience something tangible, since I knew as Software Engineers, we would likely be one of the only teams to have a software idea.

We placed joint 2nd, amongst start-up veterans who had launched 6 - 7 figure start-ups in the past, and newbies alike.

Somewhat disheartened as the judges referred to the idea as ambigious and not complete, stating that it was difficult to understand, despite the documents provided.

We were pretty disheartened, knowing we had done everything we could and more. We went our seperate ways, and ended up not seeing Wizoid again for the rest of the semester, while me and Adil cooked up other projects that would end in a loss in their own ways.

## Lessons Learned

1. I knew I had to improve my public speaking. It went far better than expected, but there was definitely room for improvements. I should have practiced more and used the powerpoint to deliever a laser focus on what we plan to provide.

2. I built confidence as a leader. We had a very successful run, considering the time constraints and the lack of motivation provided by the competitions somewhat dire rewards (massively reduced from years before). We wanted to see this idea through.

3. Iterate more. Keep refining, never stop.
