# focus-whitepaper

## What is this?

Me and my 2 friends entered into a start-up competition which was hosted by Lancaster University's entreprenurship society.

We were given 3 words we had to center our idea from. However, I cannot recall them.

The objective was to come up with an idea that was eco-friendly and ultimately reduce paper use. There was also some other very restrictive stipulations that made the idea have to be extremely nuanced.

## What did we come up with?

Within a few minutes I already came up with what we would later decide upon.

We were the smallest group. Most teams had atleast 5 members, and with only ~5 hours to actually build something, we decided to stay up through the night so that we could not only deliever a presentation, but a prototype and a whitepaper to go along with an idea we beleived to be well-worth the investment of our time.

## My Team

It was my idea to enter the competition, so I naturally assumed the leader role. I gave them a plan of my idea, micro-managed and made sure we all knew exactly what we wanted to bring to life, while being able to collabrate freely. By the time we begun, we all had a singular focus (no pun intended) as to what this project was.

My friend, Adil, who was second in command and helped direct the creative process of the paper and powerpoint. He quality assured everything, every final touch was made by him, giving quick and precise feedback as to what we need to improve or change. His role naturally became the creative.

His friend, who we refer to as "Wizoid", assumed the main turning cog for our project. We needed to crunch hard, the idea was to present a whitepaper which other groups wouldn't have had time to produce, since the objective was a powerpoint, to gain a massive advantage, despite our numbers disadvantage.

The whitepaper would include much more in-depth market research, the benefits and story of our solution. We gave Charlie a set of questions we needed answering and we let him loose on crunching the data required, he'd pass that off to Adil, who would make the infographics while I was writing our story and creating the powerpoint which I would later present.

## The Outcome

When the time came, we printed our white-paper, put them infront of the judges and I presented our powerpoint.

We decided in the end to scrap the prototype. Nobody else would have one, but ultimately I wanted to show the audience something tangible, since I knew as Software Engineers, we would likely be one of the only teams to have a software idea.

We placed joint 2nd, amongst start-up veterans who had launched 6 - 7 figure start-ups in the past, and newbies alike.

Somewhat disheartened as the judges referred to the idea as ambigious and not complete, stating that it was difficult to understand, despite the documents provided.

## Lessons learned

1. I knew I had to improve my public speaking. It went far better than expected, but there was definitely room for improvements. I should have practiced more and used the powerpoint to deliever a laser focus on what we plan to provide.

2. I built confidence as a leader. We had a very successful run, considering the time constraints and the lack of motivation provided by the competitions somewhat dire rewards (massively reduced from years before). We wanted to see this idea through.

3. Iterate more. Keep refining, never stop.
